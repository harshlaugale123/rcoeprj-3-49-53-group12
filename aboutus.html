        <p>"Hunger is not a problem. It is an obscenity. How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world." – Anne Frank</p>
    <br>
    <p>HELPING HANDS is an organisation which aims to redistribute excess food from weddings, parties, events to those who are hungry.</p>
    <p>Helping hands works alongside Governments, Corporates with Social Responsibility on their minds, other partners and Volunteers to create a local chapter of excess food collection institution, which will be spread across various cities, addressing the two major challenges – namely urban and environmental, following the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
